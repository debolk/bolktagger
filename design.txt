Bolk Music Tagger

 The goal of this application is to process music files supplied by users. This 
 is done by using a music fingerprinter.

Goals:
 - Creating a simple and intuitive way to add music to the music library.
 - Having consistent folder/file names.
 - Deduplicating the music library
 - Enabling searching in the music library

Folders:
 - Music is stored at /pub/mp3/.tagger/records/
 - Playlists are stored at /pub/mp3/Playlists/
 - The processing queue is stored at /pub/mp3/Queue/
    and consists of the following subqueues:
    - Playlists
    - Albums

Process:
 Albums:
   All the files in the Albums queue are fingerprinted and identified online using
   AcoustID. The correct id3 tags are saved to the mp3 file. The mp3 file is stored
   in the library using the following format it it's not already there:
    Artists/Name/Album/Title.mp3
   If the file already exists, the file in the queue is deleted.

 Playlists:
   All the files in the Playlists queue are fingerprinted and identified using
   AcoustID. The correct id3 tags are saved to the mp3 file. The file will be stored
   in the music library using the previously mentioned format. Subsequently a
   symlink is created in the Playlists folder in the correct folder:
    Queue/Playlists/OWee/Rustig/intro.mp3 will create a symlink named Playlists/Owee/Rustig/intro.mp3
   If the correct id3 tags cannot be determined the mp3 file itself is copied
   to the playlists folder.
